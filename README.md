# Duquesne-Incline-Redesign

Coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JS

I redesigned the Duquesne Incline website, with a primary focus on enhancing user-friendliness and improving the discoverability of information. Additionally, I have integrated several new functionalities, such as an online ticket purchasing page and a direct contact option, to streamline communication with the Duquesne Incline. Below, you will find a brief overview of the exciting new features and design elements of the proposed website.
